  - ask for height
  - ask if they have radius or diameter
      - ask for radius 
      - ask for diameter 
      
using the shape they input it will use the corresponding volume equation
calculate the volume
calculate the surface area

return the volume and surface area to the user

ask user if they want to enter another shape

program ends





- GUI ??? <-- later, if time is available
